.SS "Caveats"

.SB "Security"
.PP
Security is a big concern\. \fBRclone\fP and \fBBorg\fP have their own encryption features but following the principle of do one thing and do it well \fBGocrypts\fP is exclusively an audited encryption file system\.
.PP
\fINote: The repeated and thus predictable header pattern of Borg files may be a vector for a sophisticated attack\.\fP

.SB "For each their own"
.PP
There is no ideal backup method\. But for most users their data can be classified in an ABC fashion: few files that they really can't lose; data with average volume and importance; voluminous but not important data\. And each of these categories will have their own ideal methods\.

.SB "Cloud synchronization"
.PP
Cloud providers are a cheap way to have an off\-site copy replicated in data centers globally\. Some people may have a limited Internet connection and may find useful to instead sync a secondary archive with higher compression and heavy use of exclusion patterns while syncing a full archive on premise\.

.SB "Granularity"
.PP
File\-based is simpler but the controlled granularity of chunk\-based is ideal\. To sync a few large size files would be a PITA because any modification would require a re\-upload of the whole file\. On the other side to sync a great number of small files directly would congest the API requests quota\. \fBBorg\fP allows tuning the chunk size and is performant\.

.SB "System backup"
.PP
Reinstalling is faster and saner than doing whole disk backups\. It's more practical to backup the system configurations and a list of installed packages\. After a fresh minimal install the user can run a script to recover the system settings\. The advantages are: no need to restart; instantly done; no voluminous disk images or tar archives; high\-granularity history of system changes\.

.SB "Task automation"
.PP
Desktops generally don't stay on 24/7 so there's a need for a tool that will reschedule missed tasks\. \fBAnacron\fP does that but unfortunately it would require the scripts to run as root\. While \fBSystemd\fP allows the scripts to run in the user environment and provides it's own logging feature through \fBJournalctl\fP\. Also many distros are coming only with \fBSystemd\fP installed\.
